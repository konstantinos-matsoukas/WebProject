			<dt><h3>Nmap</h3></dt>
			<img src="Style/Images/Nmap.png" class="img">
			<dd><p>Nmap or “Network Mapper” is one of the most popular tools on Kali Linux for information gathering. In other words, to get insights about the host, its IP address, OS detection, and similar network security details (like the number of open ports and what they are).
			It also offers features for firewall evasion and spoofing.

			<dd><p>WordPress is one of the best open source CMS and this would be the best free WordPress security auditing tool. It’s free but not open source.
			If you want to know whether a WordPress blog is vulnerable in some way, WPScan is your friend.
			In addition, it also gives you details of the plugins active. Of course, a well-secured blog may not give you a lot of details, but it is still the best tool for WordPress security scans to find potential vulnerabilities.</dd>
			

			<dt><h3>Wireshark</h3></dt>

			</iframe></p>
			<dd><p>Wireshark is the most popular network analyzer that comes baked in with Kali Linux. It can be categorized as one of the best Kali Linux tools for network sniffing as well.
			It is being actively maintained, so I would definitely recommend trying this out. And it’s really easy to install Wireshark on Linux. </p></dd>

			<dt><h3>Metasploit Framework</h3></dt>
			<dd><p>Metsploit Framework is the most used penetration testing framework. It offers two editions – one (open source) and the second is the pro version to it. With this tool, you can verify vulnerabilities, test known exploits, and perform a complete security assessment.
			Of course, the free version won’t have all the features, so if you are into serious stuff, you should compare the editions. </p>

			<dt><h3>BeEF</h3></dt>
			<iframe class="video" width="500" height="400"
			src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EL96fXFNLNA">
			</iframe></p>
			<dd><p>BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) is yet another impressive tool. It has been tailored for penetration testers to assess the security of a web browser.
			This is one of the best Kali Linux tools because a lot of users do want to know and fix the client-side problems when talking about web security.</p></dd>

			<dt><h3>John The Ripper</h3></dt>
			<img src="Style/Images/john.jpg" class="img">
			<dd><p>John the Ripper is a popular password cracker tool available on Kali Linux. It’s free and open source as well. But, if you are not interested in the <a href="https://github.com/openwall/john" target="_blank">community version</a>, you can choose the 
			<a href="https://www.openwall.com/john/pro/" target="_blank">pro version</a>for commercial use.</p></dd>
